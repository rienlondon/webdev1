		<a>Family</a>
		<p>Let’s see where do I start? I can literally write a book about my life but I won’t dare attempt to do it here and I’ll try to keep it simple. I have three grown busy bodies running around the house acting like my parents. I can hear my son yelling from afar, “mom, it's 2 A.M. you’re ruining your eyes, get off that computer!” Two of my sons are currently in college studying Psychology and Engineering. One of my sons is a serious gamer, the other wishes to become a Motivational Speaker of some sort. The girl… well, we call my eighteen year old daughter “The Girl” because she gives us all headaches. “The Girl” is an Instagram makeup guru and is currently finishing up her last year in high school. She wants to be a psychologist/beauty advisor. My God, she wants to combine the two careers together. Don’t ask…

		<a>Technical stuff</a>
		<p>My interest in computers and technology began around floppy drives, WebTV, Netscape, Netzero broadband, Southwestern bell dial up and Compaq DP2000 computers, lol. That was 16 years ago in the year 2000. I want you to Google that PC. That’s the computer I started with. I remember taking that computer apart and putting it back together. I was determined to see what was inside and how it worked because at times, it sounded like little people were inside hammering things. After my discovery of motherboards, RAM, CPUs and cooling fans, I then started working for Compaq computers on an assembly line which was later brought out by Hewlett-Packard. My job required me to build a hundred computers a day as fast as I could, then boot to test and troubleshoot. So yes, I’m a Windows girl. I didn’t get into Steve Job’s toys until November of last year. I know right, that’s so late to be learning Apple technology but you’ve got to start somewhere as the cunning of hand in tech continues to revolve.</p><p>Now what does this outdated knowledge have to do with design? I’ll tell you and please don’t judge me down there. When I learned how computers work, I wanted to start my own business. I’d see those horrible pop up ads and adware about “How to make thousandths of dollars online” so I then used this as my inspiration. Determine to find out if the art of making money online was possible; I jumped into some other unimaginable crap that actually made me thousandths of dollars a week. Yes, it was legal …. I think. I’m not going to tell you what I started doing online for 8 years but let’s move on to say I taught myself SEO in order to boost my website in the top searches of Google in a month using known white hat tactics that we still use today.</p>

		<a>At the moment</a>
		<p>From 2008 to now, as a hobby I’d design sites for fun over and over using Photoshop and export templates into Dreamweaver to code. Actually to copy and paste code with making simple modifications as we know Dreamweaver holds us by the hand which handicapped me from learning how to freehand code in the first place.  Today from a scale of 1 to 10, my experience ranges at a 7 in Html 5 and CSS as I've got more to learn. So of course, I'd definitely like to grow my skills and learn it all as this is my passion. After my 8 year run in owning a simple website with learning how to optimize it, I put my silly internet career to an end and went to Pharmacy school and I won’t bore you there… hated it. Back to technology stuff I go. I wanted a new career and a new journey in website development and relocated here to Atlanta. Now, I’m attending The Creative Circus studying Interactive Design and I couldn’t be happier because I know this is where I belong. This is something I should have been doing a long time ago. I also draw illustrations and play computer games when I’m bored. My new alias online will be Rien London as I’d like to protect my online privacy and use a pseudonym name.

		<p>I’m often quiet but observing, I'd like to think of myself as a human sponge. Ask me what I think and I'll take off gushing ideas in many directions as I am able to execute those tactics with justification and recognition. Getting to know me is to love me. Gosh, I really didn’t plan on making this so long. I can go on but I’ll stop here.
